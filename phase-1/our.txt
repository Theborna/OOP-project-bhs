0, doesnt allow me to send tab to desktop previouslywhen i touched the share buttonit allowed me to select firefox as the share method to send the tab to my synched computer now the share to firefox option doesnt show up why did it dissapear
1, shab i have firefox on all of my devices and its more safer than the internet explorer i like it i just wish it had more functions like free spywareanti virus
0, seems to keep crashing i am a big firefox fan but since i started using the android one here i can no longer watch or stream videos to my tablet big disappointment indeed
0, messed my phones default screenshot setting up i installed and everything was great until i noticed when i held down power plus home which used to take a screen shot now my phone wants to do a firefox search with this command after calling samsung there is no way to fix this short of a factory reset and losing all my data thanks firefox
0, causes a lot of battery drainage so i love firefox both on pc and android but ive noticed recently that firefox has been draining a lot of my battery before this was never an issuefirefox always ran smoothly but now certain webpages with glitch outjump back up to the top of the page on randomor just not load completely ive checked my wifi and data so that isnt the issue it seems like the app is working harder than it needs to and it always makes my phone very hot
0, glitch y i like this browser better than chrome in terms of its setup and functionbut i wish it was less glitchy the back button seems to just lock up the tab on a certain website  sad face
0, firefox is getting better  slowly it crashes regularly it doesnt play video on youtube otherwise it is a promising fast browseri still miss the gesturesswipes and a well organized homepage with my selected bookmarks see ucbrowser hd
0, it was good but the last update caused so many forced close it was good but the last update caused so many forced close now i cant really enjoy my browsing experience thanks for nothing
1, all you needeasy and gives you control openness and ease of use are clearly the main goals the software itself is greatand the various plugins available allow for even more control and customization if you want it great job
0, surprised been atleast 3 years since i switched to chrome on pc it was by chance and some luck that i stumbled upon firefox for android im absolutely hooked proper tabbed browsing helps me keep my jungle of open app state screenshots a lot simpler my favorite feature would be queing new links from other apps to be opened later neato made me install firefox again on all my other devices after a long time good going mozilla
0, keeps crashing i really do love the browser overall and the ability to install addons and plugins is amazingbut it keeps crashing on me all the time ill be browsing a page and then all of a sudden the page wont scroll for meill try and zoom in and the font wont rerenderand i cant click on anything howeverthe ui still functions normallybut i cant get anything to work on the webpages if that could somehow be fixeditd ramp ya back up to 5 stars
0, its good i had typed up a longer review but then play store decided to crash ill just say that firefox for android feels faster and more stable than the default chrome browser also the ui is less clunky
0, its getting there i used to be a chromeopera aficionado but lately they eat too much ram that my phone starts to hang firefox memory consumption is far less and its more stable howeveri dislike how websites get blurred when scrolling then slowly clear up like a jpeg being downloaded on a slow connection i use 4g and bandwidth aint a problem i know you can fix it but ill give you 4 stars for now thanks for the awesome browser
0, shite crashes constantly test 1st does nothing a browser should obviously as all basic function is gone no testing was executed prior to release      i do not use youtube or any sites that require more than a browser that loads the page without freezing  bonus crashing the operating system
0, the authority firefox is firefoxafter wandering here and there you are gonna come back to this standard browser in any platform
0, very goodbut reposition and either fix or remove the share link button the bookmarks not syncing issue was fixed a while back i have been happy with this app for a while nowi just forgot to change my previous review that isnt to say that it is without its problemshowever having gotten used to chromei find myself pressing share link rather than open link in new tab while this normally isnt a problemlately pressing share link causes the app to crash please either fix this issue and reposition share link lower or remove it altogether
1, yup first thing i thought of for comment was freedom of choicevery important some of the people making choices for us are not wellthe i thought tony bennetthe good lifeto be sussinct
0, firefox for android oknot full firefoxbut a good interpretation for small touchscreen devices firefox sync works well bookmarks and search history transfer as expected really helps following up with web searching on the road when i get home to the computer
0, awesome browser really easy to useand more importantly allows you to install ad block extensionto get rid off annoying ads love it
0, ive used firefox on all my mobile devices and computers for yearsbut since this latest update its become unusable on my galaxy note 101  links either dont work or take you to a different link on the page and the tops  bottoms of pages are obscured so only around a third of the page is visible and search boxes cant be accessed  i hate the idea of changing to chrome etcbut my tablet has been rendered useless for browsing please sort it out mozilla
1, trust worthy as always have been a long time user of firefox in all my desktops and laptops now using it on my android phones as well not settling for any other second rate browser
0, great features on firefox usually i use chrome that its a great appbut now firefox upgrade with great features include video player better and downloading you can install and experience yourselfhave fun and give them a great vote
0, inferior to desktop browser i love firefox on my desktop but the android version is terrible 1 it crashes constantly2 scrolling is very jerky3 on screen rotation the window doesnt resize4 there is no word wrap when answering certain forums5 downloaded images are not available for use in forums or whatsapp without rebooting phone6 pages are very slow to load both the preinstalled samsung browser and chrome are heads and shoulders above firefox pity
0, utter garbage didnt think i would be saying this as im a firefox user myselfbut the browser is utter garbage ive got a samsung galaxy tab s2 and the browser crashes constantly im switching to a different browser
0, refuses to clear history on exit and submitting reports does nothing since i have been reporting this for the last few months for those of you complaining about crashesthat is probably because you do not have enough internal memory to run firefox properly
0, great appbut one problem ruins it i love the firefox for android its fast and efficientand all the addons are great yetthe menu key problem ruins the app firefox will automatically turn on or off the menu key based on if it detects a hardware menu button the only  problem is it gets it wrong sometimesand theres no way to force it
0, unstablefreezes and crashes customisatins and capabilities are unmatchedbut seems to freeze way too much atm some videos wont play that do on other browsers cant even arrange bookmarks looking at other browsers now
0, another update and still crashing previously trieddisabled add ontried re installinganother new update crashing every few minutes and still cant sync data
1, nice so far i have been using firefox on my pc for the longest time and love it and its no different from the android version there are a few things i wish were a bit different but all in all im happy with it
0, slow update slow firefox just keeps on getting better with each update  so far its the only one that supports flash wo force close that i have used on 44 kitkat  keep up the great work guys
0, not as good before and rapidly getting worse if used solely for viewing sites without personalization or adjusting the settings this browser has no problems i know ofno benefits either issues begin to ariseand multiply exponentiallyupon applying any changes if using a text size other than the default a substantial lagreloading begins to occur when scrolling zooming inor outcauses large  portions of previously loaded content to go blank alsoin one week this went from the download size of 45mb to over 113mb without my adding any extras
0, browser gone back downhill constantly hangs now after last update and fcstill does not keep pages in memory when app minimised which is a pain when streaming music etcapp does not use user input options ignores them againstill no propper changelog for  latest version either in playstore description or on mozzs www page  shame that ff are not listening to its users and seem totally ignorant to the fact that there is a rating system on playstore  also they keep editing my review
1, better background playback and new tab position firefox is the bestlooking browser on android if i do say so myself what i hope for are video sounds playing smoothly when the app runs in the background since i use youtube as ambience a lot and the new tab button being on top of the menu like the other browsers to make navigation easier
0, almost good enough i have tried lots of android browsers the reason being that i like speed and simplicity and good bookmark management thats all i need i tried firefox which i use on desktop as a way of getting away from chromebecause i absolutely hate google and everything and everybody associated with it seriouslyi hate google unfortunatelychrome is still hands down the best browser ive used on android firefox started out finebut became slower and glitchier as i used itlike everything except chrome meh
1, good as far as i have it fast and reliable for now only thing is that scroll speed is somewhat faastbut thats mayth be due some option in phone maybee
1, nice browser but there is no doubt that firefox is one of the best browsers out there be it pc or mobile great options to customize the browser to suit your needs however this still continues to be my secondary browser as cm browser is still way to fast even when loading heavy websites i hope the speed improves in newer versions and ill add a 5 star rating
1, the best android browser fastwell designedeasy tab managementi was looking for a browser easier to use than google chrome and its donegreat
0, gave u too many chances i love desktop firefoxthis app is brutally annoying an cumbersomeive installed it about 5 times thinkinghoping it would get better there are much better browsers for android than this eg dolphin or maxthon
0, installed and immediately deleted this crap i have used firefox on my desktop for longer then i can remember and i will continue to only use it on my desktop your only options for a homepage are the crap they want you to see or a blank page with nothing on it and you cant go to a bookmarked website unless you want to go back to their crappy homepage just to see your bookmark list  and did i mention its crap

1, very useful
0, its cool my brother doesnt bug m me anymore i show him angry birds and his mouth shuts but some levels are almost impossible and i have to wait for free power ups or buy them
1, good this is a great game good challenges too something you can just easily wip out when you are bored keep on coming with more great games rovio entertainment
1, 1 great game challenging to the point where you dont want to give it up great thing while youre boredwaiting or just want to play cant stop playing great job rovio
1, funny this game is nearly perfect except for ads and then you look at the sequel and think wow rovio messed up our beloved birds used to be such a great franchise
0, great gamereally dislike the ads i usually dont  write reviewsbut this time i am because its getting  ridiculous every few rounds you play an ad will pop up out of nowhere while you are playing and interrupt your playing sessions making it extremely annoying i know the ads help with money butat least reduce the amount of time until the next ad pops upand forces you to watch it
1, how to upgrade angry birds angry birds is really cool however if you were to upgrade it i would make more birds do different thingssecond make more challenges and be able to customise your own birds with armour and different powers then  when you know what maps you have to destroy you can choose what bird will be best to use
1, great fun very addictive still brilliant loads o fun very clever and hugely moreish and i still love it
1, way to ruin it this game was good at one point  i supported this game with real money  if you cant say anything nice i hope other people can find a good time playing this
1, great little game this is a great little game  i am completely addicted to this game  its simple enough to learnbut has enough variety to keep you  interested  this is an ad supported gamejust so you know  i would be happy to buy the game together rid of the adshowever i havent found where to do that yet
0, adsads and more ads i dont mind having ads but when its a 30 second long commercial between each game it becomes annoying to me i deleted this i dont remember that many ads last time i played this if you can handle ads all the time its a fun game to play but no longer for me
1, awesome game but this is such a great game but there are way to many adds every time you get passed a level theres another add but even with all the adds its still an amazing game
1, angry birds what looks easy can demand a bit of skill the player may become frustratedbut is never bored i always find angry birds a great way to pass the time most adverts allow a skip click
1, always entertaining we all know angry birds by now definitely an enjoyable and entertaining game to help you kill time the only thing that i dont like about it are the advertisements when im playing with my wifi of data turned on they can be a bit disruptive during game play
0, freaking awesome it has no real story line but it doesnt matterthis was the first video game i ever played so i obviously love itits almost better than super mario brother for crying out loudthe characters are greatthe pigs are cuteand it has my favorite bird in it hall or green birdnot gonna get in to the details of why i love hall but mea also the pigs forts are awesome so thats why i rated angry birds five out of five game of the year
0, great gametoo much ads angry birds is fun and a great way to kill timeunfortunately it falls short of perfect due to numerous ads littering the game unless you get adfreebe prepared to get ads up the butt
0, pretty good the people who dont like the power ups can just turn them off in the first part of the game i also like the reds mighty feathers
0, smart and fun im late to the party if i knew it was this fun id have downloaded it sooner
1, lovely a lovely game for all i love this game so much and my mom too  my mom also enjoy this game so much  thank you rovio team to make this kind of game
1, kinda like a 2d kingdom havoc fun  if kingdom havoc was 2d and used a sling shotitd be close  angry birds is crazy good though  a handful of colorful birds with different and interesting superpowers keep things fresh from level to level  this game gets more difficult along the waybut its cool to get better as you practice
0, classic game ruined by ads uninstalled this o one classic game utterly unplayable due to excessive ads installed the other day for my 5 year old to keep him quiet wondered why he kept crying and complaining realised he was constantly being bombarded with adds that took him out of the game after almost every level ridiculous
1, the best game about they dont call this the no1 app for nothingits the original and best clean game about one needs to work out how best to strike the piggy structures by flinging the birds in a sling funny thoughi thought they had wings it is a wonderful novel idea for a game and will no doubt will continue to appeal to a wide audience for some time to come its as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s its so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internetbut thankfullythe in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline
1, such an awesome game love it a really fun games definitely suggest any reader of this description to get it is so good you will enjoy the game and it doesnt feel like a waste of time afterwards it is very easy to play and its very fun to find ways to knock down the building just by using one bird thoroughly recommend it it is very fun and youre so good so please download this game will be blessed
1, cool really great and awesome graphics offline is great for going to a nowifi place love it
0, i remember back when this was a 3 ipod app not filled with bullshit like adds and powerups go back to what you used to be rio ruined every other angry birds game
0, 2many adds great game ruined by too many adds way too many adds now not even fun anymore was greatnow its terrible
0, game glitches niceyou have all the cheesysimple reviews right up first heyrobin i was nearly completed the game and i had to uninstallreinstalllosing all my achievements and its still freezing up it even switches to one if those annoying 30 ads in the middle of a game is there a reason why my game was working just fine until the update
0, good time waster good funbut getting old and spams ads really bad
0, not the same with my hand on my heart i can honestly say that the first angry birds was great the latter is a horrible mess of horrible games cashing in on the original success unfortunatelythis hame has suffered the same fate it is no longer the brilliant game it once was its  an updated versionwith none of the original stuff that once made it great
1, love it i love angry birdsi can sit and play on for hours upon end love the challenges they threw at me
0, game ruined because of ads i felt like redownloading after havent playing it in awhilebut i was immediately frustrated a 20 secondawful mobile game ad popped up after the second leveland after looking at the storei realized that you have to pay to remove ads yepuninstalling
0, ads way to many ads cant even enjoy the game with the amount of ads i have to watch every other level theres an ad thats just ridiculous
